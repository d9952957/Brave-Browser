## Brave-Browser 2025

 Enjoying private search? Try the browser that puts you first ...Even though Brave is based on Chromium, which is the basis for Google Chrome, the developers behind the project have “stripped” it clean of all elements that send data back to Google. Speaking of privacy, Brave really takes it very seriously, a fact easily demonstrated by the fact that the browser has built-in access to Tor (onion-routing network). This is handy for perfectly concealing your identity and location online and can even act as a gateway towards the Darknet.

Since the privacy and security aspect will be its selling point for most users out there, we’ll start with that. First and foremost, Brave includes a built-in ad-blocker, not just any ad-blocker – one of the best. This means that you don’t have to go through the trouble of finding and installing the “perfect” third-party extension for this purpose.
